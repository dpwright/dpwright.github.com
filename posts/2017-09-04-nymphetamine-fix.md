I've been on a bit of a Cradle of Filth nostalgia rush recently, so I decided
to write an arrangement of their song, *Nymphetamine Fix*, from the album of
(almost) the same name, *Nymphetamine*.  I'm still working on actually being
able to *play* this arrangement, but I have got a MIDI rendering of it you can
listen to here:

I should note that I didn't just do this by ear (which I'm rubbish at); I made
the use of the following resources while I was arranging it:

- [Nymphetamine tab on Songsterr][tabs], which I used to get a basic feel for
  the song, and
- [Christine Palethorpe's piano arrangement][piano], which was especially
  useful for getting the vocal melodies, as well as some other nice bits which
  I brazenly stole.  There is a [recording of this piano arrangement on her
  YouTube channel][bluello] which is definitely worth checking out.

You can download versions engraved in traditional notation, tablature, or both
below:

If you aren't familiar with Cradle of Filth or their song *Nymphetamine Fix*,
here's the official video.  It is a bit louder than the solo guitar version
above.
