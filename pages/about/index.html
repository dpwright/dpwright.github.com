              <p>This is the personal website of Daniel P. Wright, a programmer currently living in California. Previously, I’ve worked in the games industry in the UK and Japan. My main interests are in functional programming, automation, maths and games, so I mainly blog about those. The two tools I probably make the most use of are vim and git, so when I come across a useful tip for either of those I’ll often note it here, for my own benefit more than anybody else’s!</p>
<p>I mostly blog in English, but given that I used to live in Japan and was involved in the functional programming community in Kansai I sometimes post in Japanese as well. This is particularly true of writeups for any talks I gave there. If you are interested in Japanese content in particular, there is a <a href="https://www.dpwright.com/tags/日本語">tag</a> for that.</p>
<p>I also have a podcast, <a href="https://station13.fm">Station 13</a>. You should subscribe to it!</p>

<h2 id="literate-programming">Literate Programming</h2>
<p>Another topic of interest for me is literate programming, a technique by which program source code and documentation are fused into a single blog post / article / book, intended for humans to read but also directly compilable into actual, working code. Making use of literate programming when writing the blog posts on this website is useful if for nothing else than to check that the examples I include actually work – nearly all the code you see on this site will at least compile, a fact which is checked whenever I rebuild the site.</p>
<p>In fact, this site itself is a literate program, being generated by the unimaginatively titled <a href="https://www.dpwright.com/tags/generating%20this%20website">generating this website</a> series of posts, which is ongoing at the time of writing.</p>
<p>All literate programs on this site can be seen by checking the <a href="https://www.dpwright.com/tags/literate-programs">literate-programs</a> tag.</p>
