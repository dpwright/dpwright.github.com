title: about this site
---

This is the personal website of Daniel P. Wright, a games programmer living and
working in Japan.  My main interests are in functional programming, automation,
maths and games, so I mainly blog about those.  The two tools I probably make
the most use of are vim and git, so when I come across a useful tip for either
of those I'll often note it here, for my own benefit more than anybody else's!

I mostly blog in English, but given that I live in Japan and am involved in the
functional programming community in Kansai I will sometimes post in Japanese as
well.  This is particularly true of writeups for any talks I give here.  If you
are interested in Japanese content in particular, there is a [tag][日本語] for
that.

Literate Programming
--------------------

Another topic of interest for me is literate programming, a technique by which
program source code and documentation are fused into a single blog post /
article / book, intended for humans to read but also directly compilable into
actual, working code.  Making use of literate programming when writing the blog
posts on this website is useful if for nothing else than to check that the
examples I include actually work -- nearly all the code you see on this site
will at least compile, a fact which is checked whenever I rebuild the site.

In fact, this site itself is a literate program, being generated by the
unimaginatively titled [generating this website] series of posts, which is
ongoing at the time of writing.

All literate programs on this site can be seen by checking the
[literate-programs] tag.
