    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This script looks at the current status of the DAG to find the children of the
current branch, runs an action, then rebases those children.  It is particularly
useful for users of <code>git-svn</code>, who may find themselves having to rebase all
topic branches (and sub-topics which build off those) every time they <code>git svn
rebase</code> or <code>git svn dcommit</code>.</p>

<p>For pure git projects, this is considered by many to be bad form, so use with
discretion.  People who like a linear history might like it.</p>

<p>I expect the script, in its current state, will fail in cases where the rebase
can't be done automatically, but for simple day-to-day operations it makes
<code>git-svn</code> that bit less painful to use :-)</p>

    <updated>2012-05-30T14:36:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://dpwright.github.com/blog/2012/05/30/svn-post-commit-hook-email-file-owner</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's a common enough situation: we want SVN to email a notification to
developers when somebody modifies a file they are in control of. SVN post-commit
hooks let us send an email when the file is modified; but how do we determine to
whom that email should be sent?</p>

<p>I came up with two solutions. Neither is very clever, but they both give a
little clue at least. The first looks through the log and determines who has
committed changes to that file the greatest number of times. The second looks at
the blame log for the file to determine who has modified the most <em>lines</em> in the
file. My script just emails both people</p>

<p>Just copy the script below and call it from your <code>post-commit</code> file to get
started. You'll want to change the value of DOMAIN to match the domain you want
to email notifications to. The third parameter is the name of the project, so
you can use the script for multiple repositories.</p>

<p>I just threw this script together so it's nothing special -- if you'd like to
make improvements why not <a href="https://gist.github.com/2833953">fork the gist</a>?</p>

    <link href="http://dpwright.github.com/blog/2012/04/16/using-ruby-to-send-mail-through-gmails-smtp-servers/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-16T09:59:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://dpwright.github.com/blog/2012/04/16/using-ruby-to-send-mail-through-gmails-smtp-servers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I ran into a problem.  I have a script set up on my Dreamhost
server which occasionally sends me notification emails.  It had been running
fine for a couple of weeks, but suddenly they stopped coming through.  I checked
the logs and saw I'd been getting an "Access Denied" error from the SMTP
server:</p>

<blockquote><p>554 5.7.1 &lt;mail@address.com&gt;: Recipient address rejected: Access denied</p></blockquote>

<p>Up until this point I'd simply been using 'localhost' as my SMTP server, but I
guess they might not like me doing that.  I'm not sure whether the servers they
use to manage their users' email are the same as their hosting servers, and
either way I'd switched to using Google Apps to manage my email years ago.  The
easiest solution, it seemed, was to switch to using Google's SMTP server.</p>

<p>Just switching the server addresses and adding username/password info wasn't
enough though -- the connection was refused:</p>

<blockquote><p>Connection refused - connect(2) (Errno::ECONNREFUSED)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is because Google mail only supports TLS/SSL connections (quite sensibly). 
Unfortunately, it seems the version of Ruby installed on Dreamhost's servers by
default (1.8.7) doesn't support TLS connections out of the box.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there's a gem for that!  If you <code>gem install tlsmail</code>,
the enable_tls function becomes available and you can communicate with Google
Mail's servers.</p>

<p>I did all this, but there was still one gotcha.  Using my previous code directly
but replacing the servers with Google's resulted in the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p>555 5.5.2 Syntax error. yw3sm17774749obb.7 (Net::SMTPFatalError)</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that this is an SMTP error, rather than a Ruby one.  A little googling
turned up <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/185075">this thread</a>, which suggested
that the latest ruby version automatically adds angled brackets to the email
address you supply to Net::SMTP's send_message function.  I hadn't upgraded my
Ruby version, but I had made use of the tlsmail gem, so maybe that had done it.</p>

<p>I modified the call so that it specified the email address alone, without the
name or angled brackets.  I left the headers in the message itself intact.  It
worked!  Here's the resulting code:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2395670.js?file=rubygmail.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'tlsmail'

msg=&lt;&lt;EOF
From: Test Sender &lt;sender@domain.com&gt;
To: Test Recipient &lt;recipient@domain.com&gt;
Subject: test

This is a test
EOF

Net::SMTP.enable_tls(OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE)
Net::SMTP.start('smtp.gmail.com', 587, 'domain.com', 'sender@domain.com', 'password', :login) do |smtp|
        smtp.send_message msg, &quot;sender@domain.com&quot;, &quot;recipient@domain.com&quot;
end</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Note this works with mail provided by Google Apps as well as plain vanilla
Google Mail. In the latter case, specify "gmail.com" as the domain, otherwise
use your own.</p>
