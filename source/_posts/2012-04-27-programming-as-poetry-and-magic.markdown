{% blockquote Frederick P. Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month %}
The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
thought-stuff. He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of
the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and
rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. Yet the
program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves
and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It
prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth
and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a
keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor
could be. ... The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too.
If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper
form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect,
and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for
perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.
